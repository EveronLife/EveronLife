{"meta":{"id":"5D6EBC81EB1842EF","name":"Enfusion Persistence Framework","description":"A framework to save and load the world state in Enfusion engine powered games. This framework is built on top of the Enfusion Database Framework. The persistence logic is responsible for collecting and translating the world state (relevant game entities and scripted instances) into DB entities which the DB framework can then store. On server restart all changes from the last session are requested from the DB and the save-data is applied back onto the world so players can continue to play.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/Arkensor/EnfusionPersistenceFramework","type":1,"createdAt":"2023-5-23T20:22:34.0Z","updatedAt":"2024-3-15T15:46:7.0Z","scriptFlags":0,"versions":[{"version":"0.6.5","gameVersion":"1.1.0.34","changelog":"- Fix BadVec assert #36","dependencies":[{"assetId":"5D6EA74A94173EDF","assetName":"Enfusion Database Framework","version":"0.6.5"}],"scenarios":[],"env":7,"package":{"totalSize":120994,"files":[{"isDownloaded":true,"size":88017,"downloadedSize":0,"filePath":"$profile:../addons/EnfusionPersistenceFramework_5D6EBC81EB1842EF//data.pak","updatedAt":"2024-03-15T15:46:02.000Z","name":"data.pak"},{"isDownloaded":true,"size":7526,"downloadedSize":0,"filePath":"$profile:../addons/EnfusionPersistenceFramework_5D6EBC81EB1842EF//resourceDatabase.rdb","updatedAt":"2024-03-15T15:46:02.000Z","name":"resourceDatabase.rdb"},{"isDownloaded":true,"size":181,"downloadedSize":0,"filePath":"$profile:../addons/EnfusionPersistenceFramework_5D6EBC81EB1842EF//EnfusionPersistenceFramework.gproj","updatedAt":"2024-03-15T15:46:02.000Z","name":"EnfusionPersistenceFramework.gproj"},{"isDownloaded":true,"size":25270,"downloadedSize":0,"filePath":"$profile:../addons/EnfusionPersistenceFramework_5D6EBC81EB1842EF//thumbnail.png","updatedAt":"2024-03-15T15:46:02.000Z","name":"thumbnail.png"}]}}],"selectedRev":0,"previews":{},"flags":6,"averageRating":0.949999988079071,"subscriberCount":5276,"ratingCount":20,"summary":"A framework to save and load the world state in Enfusion engine powered games.","license":"Custom license","licenseText":"MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2023 Arkensor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
